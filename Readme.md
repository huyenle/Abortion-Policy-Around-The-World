This project is to analyze the abortion policy dataset by the World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Abortion Policies Database. The project uses an extensive questionnaire to categorize dozens of regulatory factors for each country. [Link here to the dataset](https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/) 


The main questions are:
 - How the abortion policies differ across countries?
 - How the abortion policies differ across continents?
 - Are more religious countries have stricter abortion policy?
