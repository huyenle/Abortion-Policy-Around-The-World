However, the practitioner is always free to refuse to perform such an act, but he should inform the person concerned of the condition and month of pregnancy as provided for by law."" However, in Section V which deals with practitioners' duties towards patients, the Code states in Article 141:  ""A therapeutic abortion may be performed if the intervention is the only means to save the life of the mother. When the safety of the mother that is seriously threatened requires a termination of pregnancy or the utilization of a therapeutic intervention that is capable of interrupting the pregnancy, the practitioner must consult at least two other doctors chosen for their competence, who, after review of the case, should jointly make a decision. A copy of the report of the consultation should be given to the patient and a copy kept by each of the two consultants. Also a memorandum of the decision that does not mention the name of the patient must be sent by registered mail to the Council.  If there is a therapeutic indication for the termination of pregnancy, the practitioner must yield to any refusal by the patient who is duly informed. This rule does not apply in the case of emergency and when the patient is incapable of giving consent.""

The Punjab Guidelines explain the legal situation in Pakistan as follows: “Abortion is legal in Pakistan for expanded indications in early pregnancy, generally accepted by Islamic legal scholars as up to 120 days of pregnancy, when the abortion is caused in good faith to save the woman’s life and to provide “necessary treatment”. After 120 days of pregnancy, abortion is legal only to save a woman’s life.”";https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/08-Pakistan-Punjab-Service-Delivery-Standards-and-Guidelines-Department-of-Health-Punjab-2015.pdf#page=11

Today the legal situation is as follows: there is no “eugenic indication” in the German Criminal Code. But if the pregnant woman is under considerable mental stress because prenatal diagnosis (PND) has shown genetic or prenatal damage to the unborn child and she does not consider herself mentally able to raise a disabled child, a medically indicated abortion can be granted. In this particular case, the requirement for the (medical) indication is the necessity to avert a danger to the life of the pregnant woman or a danger of grave injury to her physical or mental health.


The following is stated in Bundestag Printed Paper 13/1850: “The embryopathic indication has been rejected. As became particularly clear from the statements made by associations representing disabled people, this regulation had created the misunderstanding that the justification was based on a disabled child having an inferior right to life. But the regulations on the embryopathic indication were always based on the consideration that such cases can lead to an unacceptable strain being placed on the pregnant woman. The wording with regard to medical indication in section 218a StGB [...] enables these situations to be covered. It has thus been made clear that a disability can never lead to a lowering in the standards of protection applied to human life.”";"https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/14-GERMANY-ACT-TO-AMEND-THE-ACT-ON-ASSISTANCE-FOR-PREGNANT-WOMEN-AND-FAMILIES-1995.pdf#page=1

The Code of Canon Law states: ""A person who procures a completed abortion incurs a late sententiae excommunication."" (1) Canon 1398 does not specifically mention accomplices.

The Code of Canon Law states: ""A person who procures a completed abortion incurs a late sententiae excommunication."" (1) Canon 1398 does not specifically mention accomplices. 

Canon 1329.2 states: ""Accomplices who are not named in a law or precept incur a late sententiae penalty attached to a delict if without their assistance the delict would not have been committed, and the penalty is of such a nature that it can affect them; otherwise, they can be punished by ferendae sententiae penalties."" (2)

The Code of Canon Law defines penalties as follows: ""Generally, a penalty is ferendae sententiae, so that it does not bind the guilty party until after it has been imposed; if the law or precept expressly establishes it, however, a penalty is late sententiae, so that it is incurred ipso facto when the delict is committed."" (3)

The Code of Canon Law makes stipulations regarding persons who ""are not subject to a penalty when they have violated a law or precept"" which are relevant to abortion (2, Canon 1323). It further sets out cases in which ""the perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed"" (2, Canon 1324).

Although it is not referenced in the source list of the questionnaire, this judgment T-532 set down by the Colombian Constitutional Court in 2014, requires that the legislature take steps to develop a legal framework that guarantees women and girls rights to access safe and legal abortion services in accordance with the decision C355 of 2006.

See note";"Unlawful abortion is a crime.

The Penal Code provides in Article 227 (Surgical operation): “A person is not criminally responsible for performing in good faith and with reasonable care and skill a surgical operation upon any person for the benefit, or upon any unborn child for the preservation of the mother's life, if the performance of the operation is reasonable, having regard to the patient's state at the time and to all the circumstances of the case.”  

The following sections are relevant in regard of pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation: “Killing an unborn child 214. Any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother, is guilty of a felony known as child destruction, and shall be liable to imprisonment for life: Provided that no person shall be found guilty of an offence under this section unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother. Evidence 215. For the purposes of section 214, evidence that a woman had at any material time been pregnant for a period of 28 weeks or more shall be prima facie proof that she was at that time pregnant of a child capable of being born alive.”

Oceania;Melanesia;MH;Marshall Islands;7 May 2017;;No data found see note;"The Code of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands states in Section 51: ""Every person who shall unlawfully cause the miscarriage or premature delivery of a woman, with the intent to do so, shall be guilty of abortion and upon conviction thereof shall be imprisoned for a period of not more than five years. ""
In 1970, the Trial Division of the High Court, Yap District, considered the case of a woman charged with having unlawfully caused her own abortion. The court held that the section of the Trust Territory Code pertaining to abortion was so vague and indefinite that its attempted enforcement in the case in question constituted a denial of due process to the defendant and it was therefore invalid.
More generally, the court found that under the abortion section of this Code the persons liable are determinable by inference only and such indefiniteness and vagueness constitutes a denial of due process. It stated that criminal punishment was due only in cases where the intent to cause an abortion was present, precluding punishment for abortion by accident. 
The court found that abortion statutes by their terms are applicable to the person causing the abortion and do not apply, without specific provision to the pregnant woman who is the victim of the act. Unless the abortion statute expressly makes the woman responsible, it is generally held, although the statute reads any ""person,"" that she is not liable to any criminal prosecution, whether she solicits the act or performs it upon herself.
