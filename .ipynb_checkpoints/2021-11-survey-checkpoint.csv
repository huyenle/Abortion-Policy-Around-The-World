However, the practitioner is always free to refuse to perform such an act, but he should inform the person concerned of the condition and month of pregnancy as provided for by law."" However, in Section V which deals with practitioners' duties towards patients, the Code states in Article 141:  ""A therapeutic abortion may be performed if the intervention is the only means to save the life of the mother. When the safety of the mother that is seriously threatened requires a termination of pregnancy or the utilization of a therapeutic intervention that is capable of interrupting the pregnancy, the practitioner must consult at least two other doctors chosen for their competence, who, after review of the case, should jointly make a decision. A copy of the report of the consultation should be given to the patient and a copy kept by each of the two consultants. Also a memorandum of the decision that does not mention the name of the patient must be sent by registered mail to the Council.

","The 2012 Penal Code specifies that the authorization of a medical doctor is needed in case of for pregnancy termination when pregnancy poses serious risk to the health of the unborn baby or the pregnant woman. This medical doctor should seek advice from one other doctor where possible. By contrast the 2019 Ministry of Health order on abortion states that the risk on the health of the pregnant person or of the foetus must be confirmed by at least two medical doctors, one being a specialist in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology.

The National Protocol for Operationalisation of Exemptions for Abortion in the Penal Code, however, states: “The medical decision for pregnancy termination when pregnancy poses severe risk to the unborn baby or to pregnant woman is made by the obstetrician and gynaecologist.”",,Yes,https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/10-Rwanda-Order-on-abortion-MoH-2019.pdf#page=7,If a person who wishes to abort is a child, the application to do so is made by her legal representatives after agreeing upon it.

An authorization is required for abortion after twelve weeks of gestation.  In the cases of risk to life or health, rape, incest or when the delivery and care of a child would place a considerable strain on the woman, the separate recommendations of two physicians are needed.  Of the two physicians, one shall be a physician who renders opinions on the termination of pregnancy (physician with authority to render an opinion) while the other shall be the physician who performs the operation (operating physician). In a case when the delivery and care of a child would place a considerable strain on the woman, a report on the living conditions of the woman and her family and other circumstances shall, if this seems justified in the particular case, be requested from the social welfare authorities or from a midwife, public health nurse or person of corresponding status.  In the case of a woman who was less than 17 or more than 40 years of age at the time of conception, or has already had four children the physician who performs the operation decides.

see notes","The “eugenic indication” which used to be explicitly mentioned in section 218a no. 1 StGB-aF [old version of the German Criminal Code] was abolished by the SFHÄndG [Act to Amend the Act on Assistance for Pregnant Women and Families] of 21 August 1995 (Federal Law Gazette I p. 1050). Today the legal situation is as follows: there is no “eugenic indication” in the German Criminal Code. But if the pregnant woman is under considerable mental stress because prenatal diagnosis (PND) has shown genetic or prenatal damage to the unborn child and she does not consider herself mentally able to raise a disabled child, a medically indicated abortion can be granted. In this particular case, the requirement for the (medical) indication is the necessity to avert a danger to the life of the pregnant woman or a danger of grave injury to her physical or mental health.


The following is stated in Bundestag Printed Paper 13/1850: “The embryopathic indication has been rejected. As became particularly clear from the statements made by associations representing disabled people, this regulation had created the misunderstanding that the justification was based on a disabled child having an inferior right to life. But the regulations on the embryopathic indication were always based on the consideration that such cases can lead to an unacceptable strain being placed on the pregnant woman. The wording with regard to medical indication in section 218a StGB [...] enables these situations to be covered. It has thus been made clear that a disability can never lead to a lowering in the standards of protection applied to human life.”","https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/14-GERMANY-ACT-TO-AMEND-THE-ACT-ON-ASSISTANCE-FOR-PREGNANT-WOMEN-AND-FAMILIES-1995.pdf#page=1

See note","Under the Code of Canon Law, abortion is treated as a 'delict against human life and freedom' under Title VI (1). The Code of Canon Law states: ""A person who procures a completed abortion incurs a late sententiae excommunication."" (1) Canon 1398 does not specifically mention accomplices. 

Canon 1329.2 states: ""Accomplices who are not named in a law or precept incur a late sententiae penalty attached to a delict if without their assistance the delict would not have been committed, and the penalty is of such a nature that it can affect them; otherwise, they can be punished by ferendae sententiae penalties."" (2)

The Code of Canon Law defines penalties as follows: ""Generally, a penalty is ferendae sententiae, so that it does not bind the guilty party until after it has been imposed; if the law or precept expressly establishes it, however, a penalty is late sententiae, so that it is incurred ipso facto when the delict is committed."" (3)

The Code of Canon Law makes stipulations regarding persons who ""are not subject to a penalty when they have violated a law or precept"" which are relevant to abortion (2, Canon 1323). It further sets out cases in which ""the perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed"" (2, Canon 1324). 

In an Apostolic Letter on 20 November 2016, Pope Francis stated: “I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion.” The Letter can be accessed at: http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_letters/documents/papa-francesco-lettera-ap_20161120_misericordia-et-misera.html

The Code of Canon Law states: ""A person who procures a completed abortion incurs a late sententiae excommunication."" (1) Canon 1398 does not specifically mention accomplices. 

Canon 1329.2 states: ""Accomplices who are not named in a law or precept incur a late sententiae penalty attached to a delict if without their assistance the delict would not have been committed, and the penalty is of such a nature that it can affect them; otherwise, they can be punished by ferendae sententiae penalties.""

The Code of Canon Law defines penalties as follows: ""Generally, a penalty is ferendae sententiae, so that it does not bind the guilty party until after it has been imposed; if the law or precept expressly establishes it, however, a penalty is late sententiae, so that it is incurred ipso facto when the delict is committed."" (3)

The Code of Canon Law makes stipulations regarding persons who ""are not subject to a penalty when they have violated a law or precept"" which are relevant to abortion (2, Canon 1323). It further sets out cases in which ""the perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed"" (2, Canon 1324).

Both clinicians must be on the relevant specialist register. The Interim Clinical Guidance related to risk to life or health further states that An appropriate medical practitioner is one who is on the specialist register of the Medical Council of Ireland, who may be an Obstetrician, a Psychiatrist (who preferably has expertise in perinatal mental health), or a Physician with expertise in the medical or surgical disorder that is relevant to the risk to maternal health and life. It also recommends that Obstetric Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) discussions take place for individual cases, which would form an important component of the assessment of the risk to life or health.

See note",In general, consent from the parents or guardian is required for minors under 12. In between 12 and 16 years, both the consent of the minor and the parent/guardian are needed. An exception to this is possible to prevent serious disadvantage to the girl or if the girl is sticking to her consent. In these cases it is important that the doctor determines whether the girl understands the consequences of a termination and ensures that the girl is not deciding under pressure of the parent/guardian.,,16,,"https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/03-Netherlands-Law-on-Medical-Agreement.pdf#page=2

SEE NOTE","The waiting period is 5 full days, with the abortion to occur not before the sixth day from the day the woman first consults a doctor about the abortion.  This can be reduced if the abortion is undertaken to avert imminent danger to the life or health of the woman and in “serious situations such as direct health risk to the mother, intense pregnancy symptoms, severe psychosocial problems, or fetal abnormalities.” 

Abortion can only be carried out from the sixth day after the woman has communicated her intentions to her doctor.  So there is effectively a waiting time of five days, the first day being the day of the first visit at the doctor, which means the actual ""interval"" in days between visit and abortion is five full days.  The waiting period of 6 days is reduced by a day if the doctor tells the woman three days after her first visit that he will not refer her.  In this case, the doctor must immediately give the woman a dated written note that refers to the time at which the woman came to ask for the abortion.",https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/06-Netherlands-Reporting-of-the-Termination-of-Pregnancy-Act-2014.pdf#page=26,Provider,https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/02-Netherlands-Criminal-Law.pdf#page=103,,,,No data found,,,,Not applicable,,,Yes, guidelines issued by a professional body or non-governmental organization that are endorsed by the Government,https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/05-Netherlands-Treatment-of-Pregnant-Women-2011.pdf#page=1,,,Yes, guidelines issued by a professional body or non-governmental organization that are endorsed by the Government,https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/11-Netherlands-Aftercare-Directive-Termination-of-Pregnancy-2012.pdf#page=1,,,Yes,https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/05-Netherlands-Treatment-of-Pregnant-Women-2011.pdf#page=4,,,"63  DAYS

No opposition to such a request from third parties other than the legal representative who has denied the authorization is permitted.

The guidelines related to sexual violence state health service´s obligation to report to the competent authority for the investigation the fact of the rape in order to protect women victims of violence, but in any case this should not delay or condition in any form the provision of the health care and the abortion. In the 2021 judgement, the Court stated - In no case, may the voluntary interruption of pregnancy be penalized due to the fact that there is no conviction enforceable by the crime of rape. In this regard, this Court considers that such requirement would constitute a requirement that, in practice, would promote motherhood forced of the victims, because while the gestation biologically lasts a limited time, the criminal process goes through a series of stages and has multiple instances that exceed the gestation time. So, for such effects, other options should be considered, such as reporting criminal, medical examination or sworn statement, which must be appropriately regulated by the legislator.,"https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/03-Ecuador-Guidelines-Therapeutic-abortion-Ministry-of-Health-2014.pdf#page=11

See note","There are two court judgments of significance in El Salvador in relation to abortion, listed in this questionnaire as documents 5 and 6. Neither of the two judgments challenged or changed the law banning abortion in all circumstances.  
In 2007, the judges assessed the total ban of abortion even when the life of the woman or girl is at risk, discussing the option doctors have to argue 'necessity' which is found in Article 27 of the Criminal Code. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court had to evaluate an abstract review request challenging the constitutionality of the total ban in the new criminal code approved in 1997. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, arguing that the legislature in passing the law had envisaged that an argument of 'necessity' might be made in exceptional cases and would fall under the general justifications provided in article 27 of the Criminal Code.  A second case relevant to termination of pregnancy came before the Supreme Court in 2013. It related to a woman who had multiple health problems putting her life at risk if she continued with the pregnancy.

",,,Restriction Varies By Jurisdiction,,"The Induced Abortion Guidelines (2006) of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada state: “If a minor presents for abortion accompanied by a parent, it is important to ensure the youth was not coerced and the decision is voluntary. In Canadian common law and in some provinces “age of consent” follows the “mature minor” rule: the legal right to make health care decisions depends on decision-making ability rather than age; in other provinces the age of consent is consistent with the age of majority.6
The key element is the minor’s competence and capacity to understand the consequences of the procedure and the potential for complications, not her chronological age. In provinces that have not adopted the mature minor rule, health care providers can treat minors when appropriate without parental involvement, as common law invariably overrides local legislation. However, there should be documentation that the health care provider discussed the importance of involving parents in health decisions, and there must also be a reasonable impression that the intervention is in the best interests of the minor. It is imperative that health care providers be aware of the laws of the province in which they work.” 
The Guidelines can be accessed at http://sogc.org/guidelines/induced-abortion-guidelines/


In British Columbia, for instance, there is no minimum age of consent to medical treatment.  If specific conditions are met, it is not necessary to obtain consent from the infant’s parent or guardian.  The conditions are that the health care provider providing the health care: a) Has explained to the infant and has been satisfied that the infant understands the nature and consequences and the reasonably foreseeable benefits and risks of the health care; and, b) Has made reasonable efforts to determine and has concluded that the health care is in the infant’s best interests.",,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,No,https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/08-Canada-Daigle-v-Tremblay-2SCR-1989.pdf#page=1,,,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,,1,3, 5 Not Specified,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,1,2,3, 5 Not Specified,,,     ,,,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,,,Not applicable,,,,Not applicable,,,,,Not applicable,,,     ,Not applicable,,,     ,Not applicable,,,,"No data found

In some cases, a physician may require a parent’s or guardian’s permission for a woman under the age of 18 to have an abortion. If the young woman cannot or does not want to get permission from a parent or guardian, and she is able to provide informed consent for herself, a pregnancy counsellor will refer her to a physician who does not require parental consent. … In Canada, there is no legal age of consent for health care or health care procedures. People under 18 can give consent for health care/procedures if the health care provider feels the person understands the implications of receiving or not receiving care and can make an informed decision. Individual health care providers may require parental or guardian consent before they care for minors. Courts commonly recognize the concept of a “mature minor.” This is a person who has the capacity to fully appreciate the nature and consequences of a proposed health treatment, and is capable of giving informed consent. It is not based on age but on capacity to understand. The mature minor concept applies to all medical and surgical treatments, including therapeutic abortions. In Manitoba, a woman under 18 has the right to choose abortion, adoption or parenting without the consent of a parent or
guardian. The code of ethics for physicians and nurses both cite the importance of “considering the well-being of the patient” when providing care to young people with or without parental or guardian consent.”  The Handbook provides further information on the requirements imposed by different abortion service providers in Manitoba province.

The Department of Health has made changes to the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) guidelines to support access to early medical terminations of pregnancy. When a woman requires an early medical termination of pregnancy and does not have access to safe accommodation within two hours driving time of a hospital emergency service she will be eligible for financial assistance through PATS. Assistance provided will include transport and accommodation costs and automatic eligibility for an escort. The woman will be covered under the PATS program until she is discharged by a suitably qualified medical practitioner.

See note","Unlawful abortion is a crime.

The Penal Code provides in Article 227 (Surgical operation): “A person is not criminally responsible for performing in good faith and with reasonable care and skill a surgical operation upon any person for the benefit, or upon any unborn child for the preservation of the mother's life, if the performance of the operation is reasonable, having regard to the patient's state at the time and to all the circumstances of the case.”  

The following sections are relevant in regard of pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation: “Killing an unborn child 214. Any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother, is guilty of a felony known as child destruction, and shall be liable to imprisonment for life: Provided that no person shall be found guilty of an offence under this section unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother. Evidence 215. For the purposes of section 214, evidence that a woman had at any material time been pregnant for a period of 28 weeks or more shall be prima facie proof that she was at that time pregnant of a child capable of being born alive.”

Oceania,Melanesia,MH,Marshall Islands,7 May 2017,,No data found see note,"The Code of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands states in Section 51: ""Every person who shall unlawfully cause the miscarriage or premature delivery of a woman, with the intent to do so, shall be guilty of abortion and upon conviction thereof shall be imprisoned for a period of not more than five years. ""
In 1970, the Trial Division of the High Court, Yap District, considered the case of a woman charged with having unlawfully caused her own abortion. The court held that the section of the Trust Territory Code pertaining to abortion was so vague and indefinite that its attempted enforcement in the case in question constituted a denial of due process to the defendant and it was therefore invalid.
More generally, the court found that under the abortion section of this Code the persons liable are determinable by inference only and such indefiniteness and vagueness constitutes a denial of due process. It stated that criminal punishment was due only in cases where the intent to cause an abortion was present, precluding punishment for abortion by accident. 
The court found that abortion statutes by their terms are applicable to the person causing the abortion and do not apply, without specific provision to the pregnant woman who is the victim of the act. Unless the abortion statute expressly makes the woman responsible, it is generally held, although the statute reads any ""person,"" that she is not liable to any criminal prosecution, whether she solicits the act or performs it upon herself. 

No law replacing Section 51 of the Code of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands could be found. A reference to the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade in a 2004 judgment by the Supreme Court of the Marshall Islands unrelated to abortion (source 6) suggests that this judgment may be relevant to the regulation of abortion in the Marshall Islands.","https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/01-Marshall-Islands-Code-of-the-Trust-Territory-of-the-Pacific-Islands.pdf#page=210

In 1970, the Trial Division of the High Court, Yap District, considered the case of a woman charged with having unlawfully caused her own abortion.

More generally, the court found that under the abortion section of this Code the persons liable are determinable by inference only and such indefiniteness and vagueness constitutes a denial of due process. It stated that criminal punishment was due only in cases where the intent to cause an abortion was present, precluding punishment for abortion by accident. 
The court found that abortion statutes by their terms are applicable to the person causing the abortion and do not apply, without specific provision to the pregnant woman who is the victim of the act. Unless the abortion statute expressly makes the woman responsible, it is generally held, although the statute reads any ""person,"" that she is not liable to any criminal prosecution, whether she solicits the act or performs it upon herself. 

No law replacing Section 51 of the Code of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands could be found. A reference to the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade in a 2004 judgment by the Supreme Court of the Marshall Islands unrelated to abortion (source 6) suggests that this judgment may be relevant to the regulation of abortion in the Marshall Islands.","https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/documents/countries/01-Marshall-Islands-Code-of-the-Trust-Territory-of-the-Pacific-Islands.pdf#page=210

In 1970, the Trial Division of the High Court, Yap District, considered the case of a woman charged with having unlawfully caused her own abortion. The court held that the section of the Trust Territory Code pertaining to abortion was so vague and indefinite that its attempted enforcement in the case in question constituted a denial of due process to the defendant and it was therefore invalid.

More generally, the court found that under the abortion section of this Code the persons liable are determinable by inference only and such indefiniteness and vagueness constitutes a denial of due process. It stated that criminal punishment was due only in cases where the intent to cause an abortion was present, precluding punishment for abortion by accident. 

The court found that abortion statutes by their terms are applicable to the person causing the abortion and do not apply, without specific provision to the pregnant woman who is the victim of the act.
